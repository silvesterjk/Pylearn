We're creating a game with a hero and a monster. 

-- We'll create enemies and heroes with different attributes.
-- Different types of enemies: goblin, troll, dragon
-- Different types of heroes: warrior, mage, rogue

-- Each enemy with have a name, health, attack power and attack damage.
-- Each hero will have a name, health, attack power and attack damage.

-- This will be built with the four pillars of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
