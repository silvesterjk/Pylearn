We're creating a game with a hero and a monster. 

-- We'll create enemies and heroes with different attributes.
-- Different types of enemies: goblin, troll, dragon
-- Different types of heroes: warrior, mage, rogue

-- Each enemy with have a name, health, attack power and attack damage.
-- Each hero will have a name, health, attack power and attack damage.

-- This will be built with the four pillars of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

We'll start by creating the classes for the enemies and heroes.

1. Abstraction is like a flash light with on and off switch. You don't need to know how it works, just that it works.
   -- It essentially abstracts the details of how it works.
   -- User just needs to interact with the on/off switch. The interface.
